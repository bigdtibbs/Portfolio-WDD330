    <li>***Reduce Cognative Load!!!<br>
      - Use only essential fields.<br>
      - Display labes inside the fields.<br>
      - Use Float labels.<br>
      - Pagenation (Break it down into sections)<br>
         * Let the user know how many pages there will be (Page 1 of 4).<br>
      - Use autofill feature.<br>
      - Passwords are a nightmare!<br>
         * Show passwords by default.<br>
         * Allow users to hide passwords if they need to/want to. Make it easy.<br>
      - Credit card forms:<br>
         * Space fields.<br>
         * Space groupings of four numbers.<br>
      - Give the user the best keyboard for the field (number pad for number entry).<br>
      - Phone Numbers:<br>
         * Don't force a copy and paste.<br>
         * Linking phone numbers on your website so that it is easier for people to call from a mobile device.<br>

  <ol>DESIGNING A BETTER MOBILE ADVERTISING USER EXPERIENCE<br>
    <li>How do people respond to technologic developments?</li><br>
    <li>Advertising can take up more of a webpage than actual content.<br>
      Users didn't come to your website to look at ads.<br>
      Keep it simplea nd sleek.<br>
      Make sure it's unobtrusive. Content first.<br>
    </li><br>
    <li>BAD advertising techniques<br>
      * Popup advertising is BAD. Don't use it.<br>
      * Disgusing adds as content is BAD.<br>
      * Putting adds at the top of the page so people have to scroll to find their content is BAD.<br>
      * Permanant advertisement banner where your thumb is likely to contact is BAD.<br>
    </li><br>
    <li>Good advertising techniques<br>
      * Make them small and simple.<br>
         - An add that reveals when clicked.<br>
         - An add that scrolls out when clicked.<br>
         - A window that shows an add through the content.<br>
        </li><br>
