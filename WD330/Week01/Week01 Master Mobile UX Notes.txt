DESIGNING A BETTER MOBILE ADVERTISING USER EXPERIENCE

How do people respond to technologic developments?

Advertising can take up more of a webpage than actual content.
Users didn't come to your website to look at ads.
Keep it simplea nd sleek.
Make sure it's unobtrusive. Content first.

BAD advertising techniques
* Popup advertising is BAD. Don't use it.
* Disgusing adds as content is BAD.
* Putting adds at the top of the page so people have to scroll to find their content is BAD.
* Permanant advertisement banner where your thumb is likely to contact is BAD.

Good advertising techniques
* Make them small and simple.
   - An add that reveals when clicked.
   - An add that scrolls out when clicked.
   - A window that shows an add through the content.
